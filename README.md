I made this map for the people who just got covid or are exposed to covid. It is also helpful for people who want to know their covid status. 
It should be helpful for them to find a place that they need. Three things are included in this map. The location and area for all the public hospitals in Vancouver. 
Those are the polygons coloured in red. The location of all the government-approved covid test locations is named on the map. And lots of places where they can get a 
rapid self-test kit. I want to include the population density of different locations on the map since people who might be positive of covid should avoid going anywhere
that has a high density of people. I designed to hide the names of all the places that can get a rapid self-test kit. But if you zoom closely the name will start to 
appear. It worked well. 

The map could be improved in several ways. First of all, we could add population density to the map. I have mentioned the reason before. Also, 
I could write some code to connect the map with real life. Based on my personal experiences, I have visited 4 locations to get one test kit. 
The rapid self-test kit is often sold out. And if I could connect this information on the map it will save people a lot of time.
If the kit is sold out at one place the icon will disappear. 

I have used some of the readings provided and considered them in my map-making process. 
Like I have used a white style so that the audience will not be bothered by the fancy useless information.
I have modifies the style a little bit to remove the information that I donâ€™t need for the map.
